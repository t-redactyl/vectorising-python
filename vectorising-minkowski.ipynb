    "# Just enough linear algebra to optimise the Minkowski distance\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last blog post, we discussed how to calculate the Manhattan and Euclidean distances from first principles. However, in that post, we did a very manual implementation for a single pair of vectors, which would not generalise well to more than one pair and would become cumbersome for more than a few dimensions. As such, in this blog post we will discuss how to implement the Minkowski distance calculation for vectors of any number of dimensions and for any numbers of pairs. As doing pairwise calculations can become very computationally expensive, we will also discuss how to optimise our distance calculations using some further knowledge from linear algebra.\n",

While we can't avoid this looping, we can take advantage of some mathematical properties of the powers we're working with.\n",

    "In the previous blog post when calculating the Manhattan distance, I pointed out that raising the difference calculations to the power of 1 was a redundant operation as it just returns the same value. This means that when we're applying our Minkowski distance function with `p = 1`, we're wasting processing by applying the `power` function. Similarly, any number raised to the power of 2 will automatically become positive (e.g., `-2 * -2 = 2 * 2 = 4`). Therefore, when we use our Minkowski distance function with `p = 2`, it is pointless to use the `abs` function prior to squaring our values. We can therefore do one final optimisation by splitting our Minkowski function into separate Manhattan and Euclidean distance functions and removing any redundant methods."
