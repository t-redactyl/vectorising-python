    "\n",
    "In the last blog post, we discussed how to calculate the Manhattan and Euclidean distances from first principles. However, in that post, we did a very manual implementation for a single pair of vectors, which would not generalise well to more than one pair and would become cumbersome for more than a few dimensions. As such, in this blog post we will discuss how to implement the Minkowski distance calculation for vectors of any number of dimensions and for any numbers of pairs. As doing pairwise calculations can become very computationally expensive, we will also discuss how to optimise our distance calculations using some further knowledge from linear algebra.\n",
